<div>
	<p>OSCAR is a system to search the OpenStreetMap data set for items with matching tags.</p>
	<p>
		A query consists of query statements which are strings an item needs to have.
		Each query statement can be viewed as producing the set of items matching it.
		You can then make the usual operations with these sets like intersecting them.
		There is some special syntax to define the type of match and the set operation.
		See the table below for an overview. Some examples are listed underneath it.
		You may also make spatial queries which select all items in the vicinity of the given query rectangle.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you click on an item in the result list, the map will zoom to it and the item will be highlighted.
		You can click on a item to scroll to its definition in the result list.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can further improve the query by adding more statements for example by clicking on the key or values of items in the result list.
		This will add the key or key:value to the query. Some keys are special like the wikipedia or url key.
		Clicking on the value will take you to the respective wikipedia entry or the url defined as value.

	<h4>What if I don't know the tags?</h4>
	Oscar currently does not try to understand what you want to search.
	In order to find point-of-interests it is therefore necessary to input the correct tags.
	You can find a list of tags at <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features' target='blank'>OpenStreetMap</a>.
	You can also try to find your desired tag using the completion available on entering a tag.
